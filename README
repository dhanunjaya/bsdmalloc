bsdmalloc (for Linux)     Joe Damato   @joedamato   http://timetobleed.com

**WARNING:    bsdmalloc is  -NOT- threadsafe. Do *not* use in applications with threads.

Build it
========
% make

Then you can either link against libbsdmalloc.so (-lbsdmalloc) or preload:

% LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libbsdmalloc.so /path/to/app


What is bsdmalloc?
==================
bsdmalloc is a *fast* malloc implementation that I snagged from NetBSD. I did
some minimal porting work to get it to build on my amd64 Linux box.


Why another malloc?
===================
Different malloc implementations are good for different things. This particular
implementation is good if you don't care about multithreaded applications or
heap fragmentation. It has really fast malloc/free, though.


Simple, stupid, benchmark against glibc's malloc and tcmalloc
=============================================================
In my simple, stupid test, bsdmalloc is *quite a bit* faster than tcmalloc and 
*way* faster than glibc's malloc.
